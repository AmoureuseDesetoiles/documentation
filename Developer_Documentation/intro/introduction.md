##Developer Documentation intro

The Developer Documentation sub-site is where information relevant 
to software developers working on Zen Cart is stored.  The 
following releases currently have their own documentation folders: 

- [1.5.x (1.5.5, 1.5.6, 1.5.7)](1.5.5)
- [v2 (temporarily on hold)](v2)

## Development Environment for Zen Cart

### Writing PHP code for Zen Cart requires no particularly special environment.

1. A PHP-aware IDE is useful. We use PhpStorm.
2. A LAMP stack is useful for running a local dev store. Common options for this include XAMPP, WAMP/MAMP, and even Laravel Valet.

### Code Formatting

Zen Cart uses PSR-2 formatting standards for "new" code. Older code uses a "modified" PSR-2 which embraces "2 spaces" for indentation, and often left the "opening curly brace" on the prior line, instead of starting on a new line.

### Version Control

We encourage you to read the section on Git.
