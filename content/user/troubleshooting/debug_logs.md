### Utilities
The following tools are available to make log handling easier:

- [Log Manager](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2123) - Automatically remove logs after a certain period of time.
- [myDEBUG log Backtrace](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1879) - shows stack trace when a log is created. Built in to Zen Cart after 1.5.5. 
- [Report All Errors](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1792) - shows more extensive error logging than is done by default in Zen Cart.
