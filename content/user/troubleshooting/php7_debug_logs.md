See also [debug logs](/user/troubleshooting/debug_logs).

There is a whole set of new debug logs that you will start seeing as hosters migrate people to newer versions of PHP.   This article will discuss 
the most common types and show you how to fix them.   

If you're getting a lot of of log activity from the Zen Cart core, 
you'll have to [do an upgrade](/user/upgrading/).  This is because
each version of Zen Cart was developed for the version of PHP that was
prevalent at the time, and newer PHP versions will cause issues with
older versions of Zen Cart.  See [this article](/user/first_steps/server_requirements/#php-version) for the mapping of Zen Cart 
version to PHP version. 

This article is focused on logs 
created by templates and mods.
