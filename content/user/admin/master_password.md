There are many cases where it is beneficial to login to a customer's account. 

- Troubleshooting a problem they are experiencing
- Placing an order on their behalf 
- Pre-loading the cart for them to complete an order.

In Zen Cart 1.5.7, a feature called "Admin Login As Customer" has been added, that allows you to select a customer's account in Admin -> Customers and login 
as them using your admin credentials. 

Prior to this version, logging in as a customer was still possible using 
one of these mods: 

- [Admin Login as Customer](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=583)
- [Master Password](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=67)
- [Encrypted Master Password](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=94)
