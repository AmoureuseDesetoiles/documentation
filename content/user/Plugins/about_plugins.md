Zen Cart is an open source software tool, which means you can modify the 
code to fit your own needs.  To enable developers to do this 
in an organized manner, a number of facilities are provided: 

* [Overrides](/user/new_user_topics/overrides/)
* [Notifiers/Observers](/dev/code/notifiers/)
* [Init System](/dev/code/init_system/)

Plugins (or <i>Add-Ons</i> or <i>Downloads</i> as they are sometimes called)
allow you to extend the capabilities of your cart without knowing 
all the details of what's involved in writing software.  Plugins each 
have their own support thread on the Zen Cart forum, and are supported 
by  the community. 

If you're a developer who wishes to create a plugin, please see 
the [Plugins Pages](/dev/plugins/) for more information.
