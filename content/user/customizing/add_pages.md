You have two options if you want to add a page to your site: 

a) Use [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/what_are_ezpages)

EZ-Pages are a great way to add new text content to your site. 
The one restriction they have is that you can't execute any PHP code on them,
but for many situations, this is not required.

b) Create a new page

The best way to create a new page is to use one of these mods as a starting point: 
- [About Us](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=86) 
- [Skinny About Us](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2198) 

The latter is somewhat less customizable but contains fewer files.
