### How do I add a new category?

Go to [Admin -> Catalog -> Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories/).  Drill down to the level where you want to add the category.  

Click the new category button.

On the next page fill in the category name, etc. in the right hand box and click save.

Note: A category can hold sub-categorie or products, but not both at the same level.

### How do I delete a category? 

Go to [Admin -> Catalog -> Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories/).  Drill down to the level where you see the category.  

Click the "X" icon (red) on the right side of the page.

From the next page, choose Delete or Cancel.

NOTE: Deleting a top level category will remove the subcategories and products it contains.
