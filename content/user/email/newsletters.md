Sending large numbers of emails (newsletters or other marketing content)
using [Send Email](/user/admin_pages/tools/send_email/) 
(or any other facility on your own hosting account) 
is no longer recommended. 

Instead, we recommend that you use an *Email Service Provider* to handle your
bulk emailing needs.  

### Exporting Email Addresses 
To export email addresses, use the [Email Address Exporter](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=6) mod. 

### MailChimp
There are several alternatives to an built-in newsletter service provider; the
best known free one is MailChimp.com. MailChimp is a professional newsletter
interface that allows emails to be sent free. As of this writing, you can have 2000 contacts, reports, automation and more. They offer a few pre-built templates
and is sufficient for most small sites. 

A [MailChimp Integration](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=425)
mod is available for Zen Cart. 

They also have paid features and now position themselves as a full marketing platform.

### Other Alternatives 
Other providers exist as well but have very limited free features or can be
expensive. Constant Contact is the best known paid provider.  At time of writing, no integration with Zen Cart exists. 

If you want to look for other options, do a web search for "newsletter provider service."
