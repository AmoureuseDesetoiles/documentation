If you are at a level where the Categories screen only shows products, 
the Action icons at the right allow you to edit, delete, move or copy 
the product, to use the 
[attributes controller](/user/admin_pages/catalog/attributes_controller/), 
the [products price manager](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_price_manager/), 
or the [meta tags editor](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_meta_tags_editor). 

The product copy operation may be done in one of two ways: 
- replicate the product, creating a duplicate product, or 
- Link this product into another category, creating a [linked product](/user/products/linked_product/).

The product edit screen allows you to set the following values for a product:
