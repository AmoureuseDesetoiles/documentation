You can download any of the Zen Cart original files (current version and older versions) by clicking on the "Home" link at the top of this page, and then clicking on the "Download Zen Cart" link found there. 

That will take you to the SourceForge site where every released version of Zen Cart is available. For versions older than the current release, you may have to navigate to the older files using the menus provided.
