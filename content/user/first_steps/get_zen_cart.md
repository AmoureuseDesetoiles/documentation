You can [download the Zen Cart software](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/) files (both current and older versions) [from SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/)

You can also find the download link on the Zen Cart website home page, at https://www.zen-cart.com

On the SourceForge site you can access every released version of Zen Cart. For versions older than the current release you may have to navigate to the older files using the menus provided.
