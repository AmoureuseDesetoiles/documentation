## Secure File Transfer 

**Do not** use plain FTP to access your server's files.  

Although this was a common way to do it back in 2003, it is no longer a good practice, since it is not secure. 

Some secure options are:
- FTPS
- SFTP
- Require explicit FTP over TLS

Availability of these specific options is hoster-dependent but at least one
of them should be available. 

If your hosting company does not offer some mechanism for secure file transfer, then they are most likely not PCI Compliant either, and you should be choosing a different hosting company who takes security seriously.
