`template_default` is the master set of template files. Don't touch these (except when doing an upgrade).

Sometimes the word `default` is also used to refer to a 
[default code file](/user/new_user_topics/no_such_file/#how-do-you-find-the-default-file) - a file that can be 
overridden using [template overrides](/user/new_user_topics/overrides/).

Zen Cart also comes with two [other templates](/user/template/other_templates): 
`responsive_classic` and `classic`. 

See the other FAQ on [template overrides](/user/template/template_overrides) for more information.
