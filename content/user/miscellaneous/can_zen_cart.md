### Can Zen Cart be integrated with Accounting Packages such as QuickBooks or Sage?
Although Zen Cart does not come with built-in accounting package integration, community members have contributed add-ons for specific packages. These may be found in the [Admin Tools](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=1) section of this site's [Plugins](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php) area.

If you are looking for integration with a specific package, it's always worth searching the main forum as you may find references to packages under development, not in the downloads area, or only available commercially that may meet your needs.

### Can customers purchase from my Zen Cart shop without creating an account?

At this time all customers must register with their full name, address and other information before going to the checkout. The ability to have more flexibility in the login/account creation/checkout process is on our roadmap for the future. The first steps towards buying without an account are scheduled for inclusion in Zen Cart in the future.
