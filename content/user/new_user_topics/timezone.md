In Zen Cart 1.5.2 and later, to set the correct time zone for both the
catalog and the admin, update the file `includes/extra_configures/set_time_zone.php` with [your timezone](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php). 

In prior versions, see [this forum post](https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?208662-date-timezone-patch-for-v1-5-1).  But you should really [upgrade](/user/upgrading/).
