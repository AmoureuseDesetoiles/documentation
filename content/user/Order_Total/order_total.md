Order Total modules allow you to add a surcharge or a discount to the order.

Zen Cart has a number of built-in order total modules which allow you to 
increase or reduce the total owed based on various factors in the order: 
* Low Order Fee - Charge a fee for orders under a specific dollar amount 
* Coupons - Create discount coupons for price reductions and free shipping 
* Group Discount - Offer discounts to groups of customers

All the line items in an order below the cart contents are order totals.
This means the Sub-Total, Tax, Shipping, and Total are displayed via order total modules. 

Zen Cart also offers a number of order total plugins: 
* [Gift Wrapping](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=267)
* [Better Together](http://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=201)
* [Quantity Discounts](http://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=135)

More order total plugins may be found [in the Other Modules plugins area](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=7).
