If you want to offer a group discount, you need to first enable group pricing

Go to: Admin->Modules->Order Total->Group Discount (ot_group_pricing).   
If it's not already installed, click Install to enable it.  

## Group Discounts

Now, in your Admin area, you have a menu item entitled "Customers".  Click on the Group Pricing option.  

Next, you create a pricing group by clicking Insert.  (Or Edit to edit an existing pricing group.)  
Fill in the details.  

## Assigning Customers to Groups 

Go to `Admin->Customers->Customers` and find the customer you want to 
add to a group.  Edit the customer, and set the Discount Pricing Group
field at the bottom of the screen.  Press Update.

The customer will now be entitled to the group discount you have 
configured.  The discount will be shown as a line item 
under the Subtotal at checkout time.
