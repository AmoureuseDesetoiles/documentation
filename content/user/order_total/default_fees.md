Zen Cart comes with some built in fees, which may be optionally applied to 
specific types of orders: 

- COD Fee - a COD may optionally be applied to any shipping module.

- Low Order Fee - if small orders incur costs for your business that make them unprofitable, you may add a configurable low order fee.
