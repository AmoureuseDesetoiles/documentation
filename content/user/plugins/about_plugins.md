Zen Cart is an open source software tool, which means the code may be 
modified to fit your own specific needs.  

Plugins allow users to extend the capabilities of Zen Cart without knowing 
all the details of what's involved in writing software.  Plugins each 
have their own support thread on the Zen Cart forum, and are supported 
by  the community. 

Plugins are sometimes also called <i>Add-Ons</i>, <i>Mods</i>, 
or <i>Downloads</i>.
The free plugins in the [Plugins Directory](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php) are sometimes called <i>Contributions</i>, whereas 
commercial plugins that must be paid for are sometimes called 
<i>Extensions</i>.  All these words refer to code modifications for 
Zen Cart that enable your store to work differently than the 
default behavior. 


To enable developers to build plugins 
in an organized manner, a number of facilities are provided: 

* [Overrides](/user/new_user_topics/overrides/)
* [Notifiers/Observers](/dev/code/notifiers/)
* [Init System](/dev/code/init_system/)

If you're a developer who wishes to create a plugin, please see 
the [Plugins Pages](/dev/plugins/) for more information. 

If you're a storeowner who wishes to see what plugins are available, please see [the Plugins Directory](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php).
