Zen Cart uses the term "product info page" to refer to a page that shows a single product (versus the [product listing](/user/products/product_listing/) page, which shows a number of products).   

Products without [attributes](/user/products/attributes_info/) may be purchased off other pages (with appropriate settings), but only the product info page allows you to set attribute values 
for products with attributes. 

The product info page also allows you to show the products description and other fields that give more information about the product to your customers.
