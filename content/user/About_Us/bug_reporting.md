Because the code is always evolving there are bound to be occasional mistakes. If you find a code glitch or bug, please report it on the forum. We take bug reports seriously, and endeavour to find resolutions to them immediately. As you've seen with our releases, we tend to post solutions for bugfixes as soon as we have them. This does not always mean a new "release", unless there is something fairly major. Patches are issued sparingly in the interest of keeping code both manageable and still current.
