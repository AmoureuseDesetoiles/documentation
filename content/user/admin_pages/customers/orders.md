The Orders page allows you to view your orders. 

It shows your orders in paginated list, with one line per order.  The most recently received order is shown first.

The columns in the list are: 

- Order ID  
- Payment and Shipping - the payment module and shipping module names are shown in stacked format.  
- Customer's name (with company name, if applicable, shown below) 
- Total value of the order
- Date purchased 
- [Order Status](/user/localization/orders_status/)
- Customer comments on the order are indicated by a yellow square.  

To the left of the order id, a red dot indicates that the order's shipping address is different from the billing address. Such orders are a greater fraud risk, which is why they are flagged in this way. 

For more information, see the [customer and order FAQs](/user/orders/).
