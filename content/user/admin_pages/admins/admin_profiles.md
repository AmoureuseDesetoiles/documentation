Admin Profiles allows you to create classes of administrators that have
access to a subset of all administration functions.  

When the database is created (or upgraded to the latest release), the 
profile *Order Processing* is created as an example.  This profile
has access to a subset of the `Customers`, `Reports` and `Discounts` menus, 
but not to the `Configuration` or `Catalog` menus.  Of course you can 
customize this to your needs or create new profiles that match your 
requirements.
