### How can I set my orders to status Shipped? 

You can add a new order status (Shipped) by going to
[Admin -> Localization -> Orders Status](/user/admin_pages/localization/orders_status/). 

Then go to [Admin -> Customers -> Orders](/user/admin_pages/customers/customers/) and update the order's status to 'Shipped' making sure that you set the *Notify Customer* radio button to *Email*.
