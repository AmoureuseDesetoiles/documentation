# Introduction

`zcgo` is a command line interface for Zen Cart that allows developer to run certain actions.

It is somewhat like the `artisan` command for `Laravel`

Currently those actions are centered around the new array style language files, but it's 
hoped in the future to allow for other commands, such as creating/updating databases without running a full installer
 etc.
