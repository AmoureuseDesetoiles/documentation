The new plugin architecture allows plugins to be encapsulated into a hierarchical directory structure
that mimics the Zen Cart directory structure. 

So plugins files no longer need to be placed within the disparate Zen Cart core directories, but rather exist 
in directories below a `zc_plugins` directory.

A new plugin manager page allows for the plugin to be installed/un-installed and enabled/disabled.
