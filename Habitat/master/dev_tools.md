Unit Testing
------------

Habitat includes a helper script to help with running unit tests within the Zen Cart testFramework.

From the command line you can do
>
`Command Line`
>
cd habitat/tools  
./unittest v160

The option given to the unittest script is a reference to a site in your habitat VM. In other words it should match the 'dir' option given in a sites block of your yaml file.
