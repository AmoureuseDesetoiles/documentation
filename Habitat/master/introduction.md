Welcome to Habitat
==================

Habitat was inspired by [Laravel Homestead](http://github.com/laravel/homestead)

Habitat is a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) based virtual machine, with a build/script system to provision the VM automatically based on settings you decide.

With default settings, it will link a current checkout of the v160 github repository to a domain name that you can access directly from your browser.

A yaml based configuration system lets you customize your system by adding new shared directories which may map to new websites, and automatically clone other github repositories/branches into those websites.

`You can contribute to this documentation using the gh-pages branch of the Habitat repository.`
