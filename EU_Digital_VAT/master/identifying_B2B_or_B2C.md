Identifying B2B or B2C
============

B2B supplies, at least between EU countries do not have to account for Digital Goods VAT. However some method of distinguishing B2B/B2C transactions is needed. Traditionally this is done by asking for the customers VAT Reference number, and also verifying same.

There are some contributions that allow for collection of VAT numbers. Need to look at them, and maybe incorporate.
